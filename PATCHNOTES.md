- Removed the Buddy Page.

- Added a shadow behind the text for the news feed for better visibility.
  
- Added prices to bundles.

## __Bugfixes__

- If you haven't played ranked yet, the app will now no longer be stuck in an infinite loading screen. *(Yes, I thought that every person in this game would have played ranked.)*
- Fixed some ranked matches taking up double space in the home screen.
- Fixed the "X" on a players profile not returning you to the playersearch screen after viewing the player's card.
- Fixed the Bundles page not showing the current Version Number at the top.
- Deleting a favourite match will no longer delete all matches.
- If you haven't marked any matches as favorites yet, the page will no longer infinitely load but instead show a text that you haven't set any matches yet.
