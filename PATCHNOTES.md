## __New Features__

- Who even reads the patchnotes these days?
    - Added a new card that pops up after an update has been installed that shows you the most important new features and fixes.

- My Program doesn't work, how do I find out what happened?
    - Added cards that pop up at the bottom if an API call fails for whatever reason. These cards contain a button to copy the info to your clipboard, so that you can post it into our #support channel on Discord.

- Added an animation to all popups.
