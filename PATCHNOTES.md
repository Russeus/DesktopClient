### New Features

- F*ck the Preset's they're boring!
    - You can now make your own Themes for VALTracker! The editor can be found in the settings. Files are easy to share, so make a theme for your Grandma and give it to her on her Birthday! (Or just make one for your Team or Friends.)

### Bugfixes

- If the API request fails, the Navbar Icon will now still load.
- Fixed the Text on Slideshows being slightly decentered.

## Update on increased Loading Times and Infinite Loading screens

- The API we are currently using is having trouble keeping up with the demand, as it is a public 3rd party API. We are working on getting our hands on an official API Key for the official API, but this might take a while. If you want to stay updated, your our [Discord](https://discord.gg/aJfQ4yHysG)!

- I will also be taking a break from any sort of new Feature Development as school is starting again, see y'all soon!
