### New Features

- Now that I though about it, that 40k isn't so cool after all.
    - The Favourite Matches Page now includes a Star next to the Matches. If clicked, it will open up a card where you can check which Match will get deleted.

- Yo, I don't really like Red!
    - You can now change the Appearance of VALTracker on the settings page! For now there's only color themes for every Agent, but soon you'll be able to make your own themes!

### Bugfixes

- The Navbar Slide Icon and Rank of a User in the Home menu now no longer take half a century to load in.
- If the player played Competitive in the last 5 matches, changing the Matches in a players profile to "All matches" failed.
