### New Features

- I've looked at this cool card for hours now, because leaving takes more than 1 click!
    - The Card view now has it's own "X" at the Top Right to bring you back to whereever you were before.

### Bugfixes

- Fixed the Patchnotes Page (again again (Yes, it works now (otherwise you wouldn't see this))).
- Opening the "Favourite Matches" Page now won't leave you stuck in a loading loop anymore.
